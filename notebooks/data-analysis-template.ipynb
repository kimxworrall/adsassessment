Further they are not necessarily near any other similar properties.\n",
    "New builds would also be difficult, as if the size of the total development is not known (only a location, and property type), and the quality of the work not yet known, then only a rough estimate can be given. A better source for this would be to look at the predicted price from the developer, and a comparison with recently sold similar new builds."
